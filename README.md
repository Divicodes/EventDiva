Experience events like never before. E-Diva is a dynamic event management app that automatically creates, manages, and organizes events from your email. The app, now on Android Mobile, combines a sleek frontend with robust backend services, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Background

**Problem** *Have you had a emails that contain a lot of information about fun and exciting events but they never end up on your calendar?*  
The problem is we get bombarded with email content. You just don't have the time to go through all the email and extract the basic information, 
like where and when it is happening. 

**Solution.** E-Diva solves that by automatically extracting the events from your emails and allows you to quickly add them to your calendar.

E-Diva is a project inspired at Samsung NextGen Hackathon September 23-24, 2023 at Fort Mason, San Francisco.
