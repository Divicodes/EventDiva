Hi Rory,

Quick news during my break! Found a vibrant Jazz Night at Central Plaza on Nov 20th â€“ imagine us under city lights with jazz tunes! ðŸŽ·âœ¨ 
Spotted a Community Health Fair on Dec 5th at Riverfront Park â€“ think workshops and mingling with fellow health buffs! ðŸ’‰ 
Lastly, thereâ€™s a refreshing Nature Walk on Jan 8th at Green Valley Reserve â€“ rejuvenation awaits! ðŸŒ¿ 
Exciting times ahead; let me know which one sparks your interest!

Cheers,

Kendrick
