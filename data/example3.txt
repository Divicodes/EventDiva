Hi Raj,

Greetings from the hospital break room, with a quick cup of coffee and a moment to catch my breath! I’ve stumbled upon a couple of upcoming city events, and I’m quite eager to share them with you.

There's a lively Jazz Night is happening on November 20th at Central Plaza. Imagine us unwinding to the rhythm of saxophones and double bass under the twinkling city lights! It promises to be a delightful evening.

Also I discovered a Community Health Fair scheduled for December 5th at Riverfront Park. There will be wellness workshops, health screenings, and I thought it would be informative and a good way for us to mingle with fellow healthcare professionals.

A friend told me there's a Nature Walk organized by the city’s wellness group on January 8th at Green Valley Reserve. It sounds like a refreshing break for us to connect with nature and rejuvenate.

What do you think? I hope one or more of these events pique your interest. Let me know when you can, looking forward to making more cherished memories!

Take care,

Nina
